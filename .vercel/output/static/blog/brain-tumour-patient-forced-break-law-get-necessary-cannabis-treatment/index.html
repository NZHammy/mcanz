He has to break the law to get the treatment. The scar from his recent operation can be seen on his skull.[/caption]</p><p>Adam Poulter had a tumour the size of a tennis ball removed from his brain but his choice of medicine could land him in jail.</p><p>The 30-year-old, who two weeks ago had the tumour removed, is adding his voice to the call to legalise cannabis, though he does not advocate for the drug's recreational use.</p><p>For him, illegally buying and taking one gram of cannabis extract each day eases the pain, and stops seizures and nausea.</p><p>He said a neurosurgeon and four doctors had told him &quot;don't stop&quot; taking cannabis oil - an illegal drug.</p><p>&quot;I have to be a criminal to have my humanity.&quot;</p><p>Poulter's ordeal began soon after he returned to the country from Western Australia five months ago.</p><p>He had a seizure soon after, leading to the discovery of a high-grade oligodendroglioma glioma cancerous brain tumour. &quot;My whole life got flipped on top of me,&quot; he said.</p><p>Two months ago Poulter started taking cannabis extract, purchased illegally, on top of his prescribed drugs and noticed a significant decrease in nausea and pain.</p><p>The seizures stopped, and only returned a two weeks ago when he was on the operating table, having stopped taking cannabis extract in the lead up to surgery.</p><p>Surgeons removed a &quot;tennis ball-sized&quot; tumour from the base of his skull that day.</p><p>While the surgery was relatively successful, it left him with partial paralysis on his left side and a hand he could not feel. He also has a metal plate with five screws covering the hole in his skull.</p><p>Poulter said he was still taking prescribed anti-convulsants and was not against conventional treatment.</p><p>He opposed being made a criminal by taking cannabis oil that he believed significantly helped what could be life-long issues.</p><p>&quot;I'm no criminal - I have never been a criminal.&quot;</p><p>Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne would not comment on individual cases, but said it was a medical issue and Poulter should discuss availability of cannabis-type medicines with his doctor.</p><p>Poulter's calls follow that of former Council of Trade Unions president Helen Kelly, who was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2015 and has been leading the charge to legalise medicinal cannabis.</p><p>Like Poulter, she has been openly breaking the law by using cannabis and said its medicinal benefits were significant.</p><p>Nelson lawyer Sue Grey recently revealed, through an Official Information Act request, some informal notes from Treasury, which calculated that legalisation would not only generate about $150 million a year in tax revenue, but also save $400m a year on enforcement of drug prohibition.</p><p>A recent poll found that the majority of New Zealanders supported decriminalisation of cannabis, which swaps criminal convictions for civil penalties, but neither National nor Labour backed the idea.</p><p><strong>- Stuff</strong></p></article>
