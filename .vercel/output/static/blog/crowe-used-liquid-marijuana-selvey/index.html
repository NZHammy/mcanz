        <article><p>Martin Crowe was self-medicating with a cannabis product in the months before his death, a friend of the iconic cricketer has said.</p><p>The former New Zealand captain and batting great died from cancer at the age of 53 on Thursday, prompting an outpouring of tributes from around the world.</p><p>Among them, former English cricketer and Guardian commentator Mike Selvey has written a piece for the British newspaper, in which he said Crowe, a close friend, had been self-medicating with liquid marijuana.</p><p>&quot;The apparently hale nature of his condition was a camouflage,&quot; Selvey wrote.</p><p>&quot;When he was awake, he said, he did indeed feel good, but rather than undergoing yet more chemotherapy he was by then self-medicating with liquid marijuana and sleeping 15 hours a day. Happy hours though, he said.&quot;</p><p>Crowe had been diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in October 2012 and underwent treatment for the cancer but it returned in September 2014.</p><p>Doctors identified his condition as double-hit lymphoma, a rare and aggressive blood disease. Only five per cent of those diagnosed with it live for longer than 12 months.</p><p>He chose not to continue with chemotherapy, opting instead to stay at home and manage his illness with natural remedies.</p><p>The claim comes a week after Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne asked staff to review the way medicinal cannabis applications were handed in New Zealand following the high-profile case of Nelson teenager Alex Renton.</p><p>His doctors were granted permission by Mr Dunne to use Elixinol, a restricted cannabidiol product, in the first such approval.</p><p>Former union boss Helen Kelly had also sought permission from Mr Dunne to use medical cannabis, but the application was subsequently withdrawn by her oncologist before a decision was required.</p></article>
