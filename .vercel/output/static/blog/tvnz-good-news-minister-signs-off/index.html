        <article><h2>There&#39;s been a victory for a group of medical marijuana camp</h2><p>[embed]https://youtu.be/318bFgax9ko[/embed]</p><p>Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne has signed off a new product for a patient who has multiple sclerosis and there is hope that the rare decision will open the door for others.</p><p>Doctor Huhana Hickey lives with multiple sclerosis and has been using Sativex to help cope with the pain.</p><p>It is the only readily available marijuana-based pharmaceutical grade product in New Zealand.</p><p>But at a cost of $1200 a month, Sativex is making Dr Hickey broke.</p><p>&quot;The overdraft is getting up to $5000 and the Kiwisaver was $6000. That's all gone,&quot; said Dr Hickey.</p><p>Now she has been given sign off by Mr Dunne to use Tilray, a new medical marijuana product that is about half the price of Sativex.</p><p>&quot;It appears to be a very good alternative and it's not a spray so I don't have to deal with the mucosal damage that happens with spray,&quot; said Dr Hickey.</p><p>This now means Mr Dunne has given three New Zealanders permission to use medical marijuana products that are not pharmaceutical grade.</p><p>His office says the minister only goes on the advice put forward by the experts in the Ministry of Health.</p><blockquote><p>I'm expecting it's going to be much easier to get further applications for Tilray&quot; Shane Le Brun of Medical Cannabis New Zealand</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Great news, it's been a long while coming,&quot; said Shane Le Brun of Medical Cannabis New Zealand.</p><p>Mr Le Brun has been helping Dr Hickey and others, and is working within the current system.</p><p>&quot;We can fundraise for legal medicines, we can advocate for alternative products which are hopefully cheaper,&quot; he said.</p><p>He hopes this latest decision will encourage doctors to advocate for marijuana based drugs more often.</p><p>&quot;Once we've got this first, one day with Tilray I'm expecting it's going to be much easier to get further applications for Tilray,&quot; said Mr Le Brun.</p><p>This week a 17,000 strong petition was presented to Parliament, calling for cannabis to be treated as a health product.</p><p>Dr Hickey agrees with the reform, but she also wants regulation.</p><p>&quot;I need to know that product is safe for me, and will address my medical needs,&quot; she said.</p><p>Dr Hickey is pleading for change so people are not forced to turn to the raw untested product.</p></article>
