The election handed an unprecedented majority to the rightwing, populist Law and Justice (PiS) party after eight years in opposition.</p><p>It is not clear whether PiS would back the rapper's draft, which has no chance of becoming law without the party's support.</p><p>Last July, a survey by the independent PBS agency showed two-thirds of Poles -- or 68 percent -- were in favour of legalising medical marijuana. Almost one in five people, or 18 percent, wanted marijuana in all forms to remain illegal, while 14 percent had no opinion.</p><p>While opponents cite studies saying marijuana causes lung cancer or psychosis, advocates contend the plant can be used for pain relief and seizure management.</p><p>Medical marijuana made Polish headlines last year after a doctor at a leading children's hospital imported it from the Netherlands to treat a child's life-threatening seizures after conventional treatments failed.</p><p>The child recovered.</p><p>The Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain have already legalised medical marijuana -- as have 23 US states.</p><p>In 2013, Uruguay became the world's first country to fully legalise marijuana.</p><p>Original article found at <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/polands-rapper-mp-unveils-bill-medical-marijuana-175704830.html">Yahoo news</a></p></article>
