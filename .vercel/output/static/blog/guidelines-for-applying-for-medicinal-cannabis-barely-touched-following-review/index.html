        <article><p>Terminally ill Helen Kelly says the Government has made her a &quot;criminal&quot; after a review of medicinal cannabis guidelines ended with little change.</p><p>More than a year ago the former Council of Trade Unions boss was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and after trying a variety of different medications she resorted to cannabis for pain relief.</p><p>Kelly continues to illegally source her own drugs after her bid for medicinal cannabis was withdrawn - the result of a &quot;complicated&quot; application process, which required information that was &quot;impossible to access&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I've been left to buy my own cancer treatment and take illegal cannabis - the whole system is stuffed.&quot;</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_3077&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;620&quot;]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463638678259.jpg" alt="erminally ill former union boss Helen Kelly continues to source cannabis for pain relief illegally."/> erminally ill former union boss Helen Kelly continues to source cannabis for pain relief illegally.[/caption]</p><p>The guidelines for that application process have been reviewed and on Thursday Associate Minister of Health Peter Dunne announced only minor changes, based on the advice of medical experts.</p><p>Kelly says Dunne's decisions around access to cannabis are impacting on her life every day.</p><p>&quot;I'm really sick at the moment...I'm really sore and I can't find a product to take that I feel comfortable operating on during the day.&quot;</p><p>The guidelines were introduced last year after Nelson teenager, Alex Renton, successfully applied to Dunne for a cannabis product, Elixinol.</p><p>Currently the only cannabis-based product available in New Zealand that doesn't require ministerial approval from Dunne is Sativex.</p><p>The feedback from the review was &quot;unanimously supportive that the guidelines and process are sound,&quot; Dunne said.</p><p>His position of a &quot;robust and scientific&quot; approach to cannabis has not changed, which means &quot;identifying the greatest therapeutic benefits and determining the most appropriate ratios, dosage and delivery mechanisms&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Otherwise we are essentially flying blind and hoping for the best, an approach that flies in the face of evidence-based medicines policy.</p><p>&quot;It is my hope that by releasing this feedback it will go some way to balancing out the irresponsible and ill-informed messages being passed off as fact, and provide a degree of reassurance to those who are genuinely looking for respite to significant health issues,&quot; he said.</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_3076&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;620&quot;]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463638678259b.jpg" alt="Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne says he will continue to take a &#34;robust and scientific'' approach to cannabis-based products."/> Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne says he will continue to take a &quot;robust and scientific'' approach to cannabis-based products.[/caption]</p><p>But Kelly says the ministry should be compiling a list of cannabis-based products for doctors to prescribe, other than Sativex, which Kelly says isn't right for her needs.</p><p>Renton, who suffered from &quot;status epilepticus&quot;, a kind of prolonged seizure, died a month after receiving Elixinol.</p><p>In April Dunne approved Aceso Calm Spray, a non-pharmaceutical grade cannabis-based product, for a patient with a severe case of Tourette's Syndrome.</p><p>Dunne instructed ministry officials, in March, to undertake consultation with a range of medical specialists and the New Zealand Medical Association, to work out whether the guidelines were still &quot;fit for purpose&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The consistent feedback from experts in their field was that cannabis-based products should be treated no differently to other medicines - evidence-based principles should and will continue to be followed&quot;.</p><p>The specialists recommended one of the guidelines - that a patient be hospitalised while being treated with a non-pharmaceutical grade cannabis product - be removed, which Dunne has adopted.</p><p>The ministry has also made changes to the terminology used around cannabis.</p><p>Instead of &quot;medicinal cannabis&quot;, the description has been changed to &quot;cannabis-based products&quot;.</p><p>&quot;The changes do not impact on the legal status of cannabis or any cannabis-based products. They have been made to provide more clarity and consistency in describing cannabis-based products, when compared to other products or substances in the area of medicines control.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Article written by Jo Moir for <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/80170457/guidelines-for-applying-for-medicinal-cannabis-barely-touched-following-review">Stuff.co.nz</a></p></article>
