        <article><p>Medicinal cannabis campaigner Lucy Haslam has responded to the Federal Government's announcement that it will legalise medicinal cannabis with a cautious welcome.</p><p>After losing her son Daniel to cancer in February this year, the former nurse has been heavily involved in political discussions surrounding legalisation.</p><p>&quot;I am pleased that politicians are ready to get on board but I hope and pray that the outcomes are in the best interests of the patients and that reform is more than political grandstanding,&quot; she said.</p><p>Over the past year, Ms Haslam has grown increasingly impatient with political delay and has been working on her own initiative to make medicinal cannabis accessible.</p><p>She has told Australian Story of a radical plan to grow and supply cannabis herself, and has already assembled a team to work on the Tamworth-based project.</p><p>&quot;At the moment we are looking for a property in Tamworth to set up a small research and development facility,&quot; Ms Haslam said.</p><p>&quot;My goal is that in the short- to mid-term we'll be able to produce a product to supply people like Dan who need compassionate access to medical cannabis now.&quot;</p><p>The team has recently applied for a New South Wales Government exemption to cultivate the drug and is waiting for a decision.</p><p>If successful they will be able to grow cannabis for research and development purposes. The ultimate aim is to supply patients who register under a 'compassionate access scheme' which is still being developed.</p><blockquote><p>I honestly think that medicinal cannabis would not be where it is today without Lucy's intervention together with Dan's.</p><p>NSW Premier Mike Baird</p></blockquote><p>Such a scheme would ensure that medicinal cannabis would not only be accessible to all those who require it, but would be priced appropriately.</p><p>&quot;The long-term goal is for medicinal cannabis to be legalised, but further to that we need to make sure that when it's legalised it's affordable,&quot; Ms Haslam said.</p><p>Ms Haslam and her husband Lou, a former drug squad officer, have put their cafe and gift shop business on the market to help fund the project in Tamworth.</p><p>The Haslams' plan is also supported by Daniel's widow Alyce.</p><p>&quot;I think Dan would possibly be a little bit surprised knowing that his mother is planning on setting up a cannabis centre in Tamworth, but I mean this whole journey has been full of surprises,&quot; she said.</p><h2>Haslams the &#39;driving force&#39; behind medicinal cannabis change</h2><p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-16/daniel-and-lucy-haslam/6862144"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6862110-3x2-700x467-1.jpg" alt="Daniel and Lucy Haslam" title="Daniel and Lucy Haslam"/></a><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-16/daniel-and-lucy-haslam/6862144"><strong>PHOTO:</strong> For three years Lucy Haslam's son Daniel experienced debilitating nausea as a result of chemotherapy and only gained relief when he began using cannabis as a medicine. (Supplied: Paul Mathews)</a></p><p>Ms Haslam is widely credited as the driving force behind various state and federal initiatives aimed at legalising the drug.</p><p>She and Daniel, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer at age 20, started campaigning for legalisation when forced to access cannabis from the black market.</p><p>NSW Premier Mike Baird told Australian Story that he was persuaded to act on the issue after meeting last year with the Haslams.</p><p>&quot;It was very clear listening to the story that I wanted to do something,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I honestly think that medicinal cannabis would not be where it is today without Lucy's intervention together with Dan's.</p><p>&quot;They have turned this debate on its head and I think the country has turned with her.&quot;</p><p>A staunch opponent of recreational drugs, Ms Haslam admits her journey has been a strange one.</p><p>&quot;I'm in a constant state of amazement at how weird my life has become. I would gladly give it up and have Dan back in a heartbeat but that's not the way life is. We just had to do this, we had no choice,&quot; she said.</p><h2>Medicinal Cannabis legislation efforts:</h2><h3>Federal initiatives</h3><ul><li>The <strong>Federal Government</strong> has announced that it will seek parliamentary support before year's end toÂ <a href="http://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2015-ley123.htm?OpenDocument&#38;yr=2015&#38;mth=10">allow the controlled cultivation of cannabis for medicinal or scientific purposes</a>. Patients may be able to access regulated medicinal cannabis as early as 2017.</li><li>The <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/Medicinal_Cannabis_Bill/Report">Regulator of Medicinal Cannabis Bill 2014</a>, a private member's bill which had cross-party support, was to have been tabled in parliament in November by <strong>the Greens</strong>. It would have established a regulator independent from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) which would have overseen a scheme to make medicinal cannabis available to patients who qualify for treatment.</li></ul><h3>State initiatives</h3><ul><li>The <strong>NSW Government</strong> has announced a <a href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/cannabis/Documents/fs-cannabis-trials.pdf">series of clinical trials to commence in 2016</a>. They include trials for children with severe, drug-resistant epilepsy; adults with terminal illness, focusing on improving quality of life and symptoms such as pain, nausea and vomiting; and adults with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, where standard treatment is ineffective.</li><li>Last December the <strong>NSW Government</strong> announced a scheme to protect certain categories of patients in possession of limited quantities of medicinal cannabis from prosecution. Patients need to register with the Government.</li><li>The <strong>NSW Government</strong> has also established a Centre for Medicinal Cannabis Research and Innovation to oversee clinical trials, research and education.</li><li>The <strong>Victorian Government</strong> has announced that it will legalise access to locally manufactured medicinal cannabis for use in exceptional circumstances from 2017 including for children with severe epilepsy.</li><li>The <strong>Victorian Government</strong> will also establish an Office of Medicinal Cannabis to oversee the manufacturing, dispensing and clinical aspects of the framework.</li></ul><p>Original source <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-19/campaigners-plan-to-supply-medical-cannabis-unchanged/6863816">ABC News</a></p></article>
