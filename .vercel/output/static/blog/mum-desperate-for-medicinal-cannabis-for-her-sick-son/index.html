We are regularly advised there is nothing left.&quot;</p><p>Dixon said doctors have never discussed anything outside of conventional treatments with her and it was only when she started doing her own research she came across Sativex and Elixinol.</p><p>She and her husband, Kelvin, have written to Dunne asking for approval but without the support of Matthew's doctor, Dunne is hamstrung by the procedure, which isn't one he plans to change.</p><p>&quot;At the end of the day cannabis oil is just another drug - no different from the powerful drugs being used to keep Alex comatose and the powerful drug that our son Matthew takes every day of his life, which does not control his seizures,&quot; she said.</p><p>While Dunne said he had considerable sympathy for the families involved, &quot;I'm not a clinician and I'm not in any position to override the clinical judgment.&quot;</p><p>But he is open to broadening access to medicinal cannabis despite Prime Minister John Key saying he wouldn't support a parliamentary debate on the matter.</p><p>&quot;We are watching closely the trials that are being undertaken in Australia. Essentially if they prove to be effective we would obviously seek to take advantage of them in New Zealand.</p><p>&quot;But the real issue beyond that is manufacturers being prepared to make those drugs available, in some cases they're not interested because they don't see the market as big enough.&quot;</p><p>Matthew is cared for at home, a full-time job for his mum, that involves having an oxygen supply and getting up as often as every half an hour in the night as he suffers another seizure.</p><p>&quot;In the morning he's like a washed up rag.&quot;</p><p>&quot;As a parent, no matter what the age of your child, you would try anything to improve their quality of life,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote></article>
