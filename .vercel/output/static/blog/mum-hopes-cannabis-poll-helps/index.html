I mean it's a plant that I can grow in the garden.&quot;</p><p>Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand co-ordinator Shane LeBrun said the decriminalisation of the drug would benefit thousands of Kiwis.</p><p>&quot;If they decriminalised it then a lot of people in chronic pain, like my wife [who suffered a spinal injury], would be able to have a bit at home without the fear of prosecution.&quot;</p><p>In a country of 4.5 million people, fewer than 40 were on Sativex, New Zealand's only legal cannabis-based drug. He said this was because many people were not even aware of its existence, with some doctors reluctant to prescribe it.</p><p>Wairarapa MP Alastair Scott said he would not advocate &quot;smoking any drug that's going to do long-term damage&quot;.</p><p>But making cannabis available for medicinal use was &quot;a no-brainer&quot;.</p><p>&quot;If you've got a doctor who prescribes some sort of cannabis-based product, or morphine-based product, or a drug that would be dangerous in the hands of the general public but the doctor wants to prescribe it then I'm absolutely in favour of the doctor being able to prescribe it.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Article written by Hayley Gastmeier for the Wairarapa Times-Age, original article can be found <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&#38;objectid=11695135">here</a></p></article>
