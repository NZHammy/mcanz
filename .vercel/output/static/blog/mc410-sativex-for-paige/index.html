She has developmental delays, especially cognitive difficulties, she's now at a mental age of about 5 years of age. Paige suffers from every seizure type there is, she was having up to 20 or more seizures a night at her worst, but after starting sativex two years ago she is down to having one to three seizures a week.  However lately Paige has been going through a rough patch of heightened seizure activity.</p><p>Sativex has cost the family well over $10,000 dollars so far, which her mother Kelly has had to fund herself from doing fundraisers, and she would also like to one day apply under the MOH Guidelines for a product that is both cheaper, and designed for Paediatric Epilepsy.</p><p>Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand (MCANZ) is pleased to announce Paige as the 5th Patient in our #MC410 fundraising campaign, aiming to ease the financial burden on families struggling with severe medical conditions.</p><p>Please consider donating to support Paige and others at Givealittle.</p><p>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://widget.givealittle.co.nz/cause/legalmcfor10/light-apollo&quot; width=&quot;730&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; seamless=&quot;seamless&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p></article>
