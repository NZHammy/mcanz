        <article><blockquote><p>I don't and I won't take cannabis till they legalize it for medical purposes. <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/narcotics.jpg" alt="Narcotics"/></p><p>At age 16 I was assaulted, and left partially paralyzed for several hours. Ironically they thought I was lying about the pain, paralysis and then numbness - it was hours before I got pain relief and even then it was only paracetamol. After four days in hospital they decided they would give me a more robust pain relief, it was too late.</p><p>I'm 45 I've suffered with Chronic pain and chronic fatigue since I was 16. I've had all the drugs - the one that killed Elvis, Codeine, Morphine, Aspirin, Paracetamol four times a day, and more and more Tramadol.</p><p>I use to work, but when I stopped using cannabis that became impossible. Why you ask? Sleeping for starters, I live for four hours unbroken sleep, Bliss is four hours sleep, then awake for two and then another 2 hours sleep. Bliss is not often. I was smaller, yeap one side effect they never tell you of codeine and Tramadol is you put on the pounds. I thought I knew what munchies was on cannabis. But it's nothing like the desire to eat all the time when on those drugs.</p><p>When I took cannabis 3 to 4 times a week exercise was simpler. I could walk for miles, and ride for Km's. Now days it harder and harder, and the pain relief from Tramadol does make walking simpler, but I don't want to pop those four times a week just to exercise. But, I'm seriously thinking about it.</p><p>The chronic fatigue is hard to predict, it can just wipe you out and make you a zombie at any time. Most employers can't have that in the workplace, I don't blame them, not in this environment, where every cent counts just to survive.</p><p>I'm lucky I have a wonderful partner and I get $57 a week from the state to live on. I don't remember asking to be assaulted, nor did I ask that my body reacted the way it did because of the assault. That said, if I could use cannabis to manage my pain and chronic fatigue I could do more, much more.....  It's been 12 years since I stopped using cannabis regularly, and 5 since I stopped using it at all. All I can say is I'm much, much worse for obeying the law. I have not work since I stopped, and my medical bills  have only increased. I've going from participating in society to sitting at it's edge.</p></blockquote></article>
