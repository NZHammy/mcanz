Tracy her mother has reported that for the first time since the initial illness took hold,  Grace can now speak!  Tracy would like to thank everyone who has helped pay for her Sativex,  the most effective med she has been on, and would like to thank all those who have prayed for Grace.  For now, please let the family enjoy the moment and respect their privacy.  Tracy's exact words to announce this via Facebook are as follows</p><blockquote><p>Well!!!!! I always hoped I could say this at some point. Grace has woken from a very long deep sleep and she can talk! Yes, you heard that right. She is talking!!!!! She has a good yes and no. Please, thank you, I asked her where her brother Gus was and she answered&quot; South Africa&quot;, I asked her what the song playing on the tv over her bed was and she said&quot; Cake by the ocean&quot;!!!!!!! So so excited, tears of joy, big goofy grin on my face, all the nurses coming to hear her, everyone is so happy. Please keep those wonderful prayers going, you guys are really good at it:) Please God, let this be a big breakthrough that doesn't go away. Please let it stay</p></blockquote><p>Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand would also like to thank you all for your support in helping Grace with her funding, and we hope Grace continues to improve.</p></article>
