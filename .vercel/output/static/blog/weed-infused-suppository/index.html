The tampon-sized vaginal suppository is blended with a 6 to 1 ratio of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oil concentrate and cannabidiol (CBD) isolate, respectively. THC works by targeting the nerves to “block out pain,” while CBD acts as an anti-inflammatory and as an antispasmodic by treating muscle spasms that occur from menstruation and ovulation.</p><p>The suppository can be inserted anytime, from a few days before menstruation to during it, while using tampons at the same time. However, Foria does warn patients painkillers should not be used without doctors' approval. If all goes well, the patients should feel pain relief within 15 to 30 minutes after insertion.</p><p>Since marijuana is still illegal under federal law, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not approve medical cannabis products, so Foria Relief’s efficacy is tough to judge. This means future patients are left with testimonials, which should always be read cautiously.</p><p>&quot;Normally, pain is unbearable. I was able to use this and have it prevent the worsening pain and cramping and piercing pains in my vaginal canal,&quot; wrote patient Megan C. on the product’s <a href="https://foriapleasure.com/products/foria-pleasure">website</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dayle M. praised the weed-infused suppository, and wrote: &quot;Finally, an all natural pain reliever specifically designed for women that works.&quot;</p><p>The medicinal use of marijuana has a long history of being used as a natural aid in women's health. A 1928 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl2hAwAAQBAJ&#38;dq=Dysmenine&#38;q=cramps#v=onepage&#38;q=cramps&#38;f=false">paper</a><em>from Pharmacotherapuetics, Materia Medica and Drug Action</em>, found cannabis has the ability to act “favorably upon the uterine musculature” and can even be used to counteract “painful menstrual cramps.” The authors also note cannabis can help ease labor pains for women.</p><p>“A woman in labor may have a more or less painless labor…if a sufficient amount of the drug is taken” without threatening the health of a newborn, they wrote.</p><p>Marijuana use among pregnant women is ill-advised. <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/will-regular-marijuana-use-turn-teen-brains-mush-yes-say-psychologists-297354">Previous studies</a> have found marijuana use in adolescents may negatively affect their brains. Moreover, there are legal implications, with some states like <a href="http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/when_the_womb_is_a_crime_scene.html">Alabama</a>, saying pregnant women caught using it could be charged with child abuse.</p><p>Foria steers clear of including pregnant women in its marketing to avoid legal implications. However, they do recommend women with <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/menstruation-and-female-brain-how-fluctuating-hormone-levels-impact-cognitive-341788">period pain</a>, especially those who suffer from<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometriosis/basics/definition/con-20013968">endometriosis</a>, try the suppository.</p><p>The product currently comes in a four-pack, containing 60 milligrams of THC and 10 mg of CBD, for $44 in most Colorado and California dispensaries. Customers can only purchase Foria Relief by becoming a member of the company's cannabis collective, and with a state-issued medical marijuana ID.</p><p>The weed-infused suppository can maximize <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-menstrual-cycle-marathon-runner-and-womens-rights-have-common-closer-look-female-348992">muscle relief during your period</a>, without a high.</p><p>Original article can be <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/womens-health-and-marijuana-weed-infused-suppository-can-relieve-period-pain-371402">found here</a> and is authored by Lizette Borelli</p></article>
