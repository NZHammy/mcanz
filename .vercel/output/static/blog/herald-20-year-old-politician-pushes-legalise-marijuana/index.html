I'm not a person who likes to whinge about things, if I see a problem I want to find a solution. We have an election here too that we should be focusing on.&quot;</p><p>She has just returned from a six-month stay in the US, after living in Ashland, Oregon. It was there she realised the benefits of serving the interests of the wider community.</p><p>&quot;I just saw so many initiatives that I would love to see brought back to my hometown. Everyone was so welcoming and loving and that really brought everyone together.</p><p>&quot;Even something like a community garden can help so much, it's a great way of helping people out and making a difference.&quot;</p><p>Far from being a political stunt, the retail manager and former student is adamant about her determination to be elected.</p><p>&quot;A lot of people see me and think I'm just doing it as a political statement, but I'm running as a serious candidate and I really want to win.</p><p>&quot;I want to give a fresh perspective on the way things are run because at the moment it's pretty pale, stale and male.</p><p>&quot;I think younger people are missing out, but that feeling of apathy is definitely changing. Given the shape of the world at the moment people are definitely more interested in politics.</p><p>She's hot on addressing transport in East Auckland. She is also keen to use a political platform to push for the legalisation of marijuana.</p><p>&quot;I would really love to get more people on buses and improve that service. A lot of students live in Howick, they study at Auckland University and they're spending one-and-a-half hours getting into town every day, it needs to be better than that.</p><p>&quot;The cannabis debate is one we love to dismiss in New Zealand, unfortunately there is a lot of social stigma around the subject here which is very disheartening.</p><p>&quot;It's been proven in all countries that have legalised so far, the number of users has gone down in those places because the stigma has been removed.</p><p>&quot;It goes the same as sex, we know teenagers are doing it so why not educate them on how to do it safely and consensually so they don't run into trouble.</p><p>&quot;Having also spent time in Oregon where cannabis is legal for anybody over 21 I have seen the effects on not only the community but the economy and industries that have been created. It's a gold mine of innovation, research and technologies over there right now.&quot;</p><p>She plans to use social media during her campaign, as well as inviting potential constituents round to her house for a chat.</p><p>&quot;I just want people to know I'm no different to them, and I want to have a discussion.&quot;</p><p>Montgomery sees a spot on the Howick Local Board as the first step in what she hopes will be a long political career.</p><p>&quot;Hopefully I'll eventually become an MP, the council is one of my more short-term goals and then it's hopefully just up from there.&quot;</p><p>National MP Jami-Lee Ross, another East Auckland politician who was elected onto the Manukau City Council as an 18-year-old, said it's &quot;encouraging&quot; to see someone so young getting involved in local body politics.</p><p>&quot;It's good to have youth voices in the mix, but she's taking on a tough challenge. Howick is a fairly conservative area but it's good for the younger generation to have someone putting themselves forward.&quot;</p><p>Montgomery is not the only twenty-something looking to defy convention and gain representation within the council.</p><p>Shail Kaushal, 22, is running for a spot on the Puketapapa Local Board. He campaigned for the same position in 2013 as a 19-year-old, but was unsuccessful.</p><p>Article by Ben Hill and originally posted on the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&#38;objectid=11684701">NZ Herald website.</a></p></article>
