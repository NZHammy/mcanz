        <article><p>Rotorua businesses have raised their hands to help fundraise for medicinal cannabis.</p><p>Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand (MCANZ) is currently doing a fundraising campaign called #MC410 for legal cannabis treatments for people in a similar situation to Zoe Jefferies, a young Rotorua girl who is responding well to Sativex for her epilepsy.</p><p>Sativex is a Ministry of Health-approved cannabis oil-based mouth spray.</p><p>MCANZ co-ordinator Shane Le Brun said Rotorua was a great place to fundraise as local businesses often came forward to help.</p><p>&quot;Most businesses think we are all a bunch of hippies, but we are quite the opposite.&quot;</p><p>During the latest campaign Hells Gate donated $500 worth of vouchers and Fernleaf Motel offered a getaway package, while backpackers Crash Palace put a charity box at the front desk for donations.</p><p>&quot;We are thankful for all the support Rotorua has shown MCANZ,&quot; he said.</p><p>Mr Le Brun said they had four main goals but needed funding to make those goals a reality.</p><p>&quot;The first is to get Sativex funded and more widely available for those in need.</p><p>&quot;The second is getting other products legally available and funded that can help.</p><p>&quot;Thirdly, we would like to get funding for medical training for our doctors so they can learn more and be confident in prescribing products like Sativex here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;And long-term we want to promote and facilitate research inside New Zealand,&quot; he said.</p><p>Crash Palace owner and NZ Hemp Brokers director Chris Woodney said he was a strong believer in hemp and had gone through the legal channels to set up a hemp-based company.</p><p>&quot;This is a plant that can help our people here in New Zealand, it's hugely beneficial. The cannabis seed is super nutritional.</p><p>&quot;The hemp industry has been going for a long time, but if we want to see a change we have to do it through the legal channels.&quot;</p><p>Fernleaf Motel owner Andrew Bell said in his view more people needed access to the treatment.</p><p>&quot;The evidence is starting to become overwhelming. You just have to look at Karen Jefferies' daughter Zoe. That treatment has helped her immensely, but it's costing between $1000 to $1200 a month for the treatment. How long can they continue to do that?</p><p>&quot;If we can get medical professionals educated then they are able to freely think about it, that would be great,&quot; he said.</p><p>Lynette David from WaiOra group and Hells Gate said it was an important issue for the community.</p><p>&quot;The people who I know who have used it, they have been less stressed and sick.</p><p>&quot;It was originally used as natural medicine, but people took it to another level. I have seen the positives, I realise it is a taboo subject, but the fundraising is for people who are so ill it can make their life a little better,&quot; she said.</p><p>The charity box Mr Woodney put out to collect donations was recently stolen. A person has been charged and will appear in the Rotorua District Court on October 21.</p><p></p><p>Article written by Kyra Dawson for the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rotorua-daily-post/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503438&#38;objectid=11719211">Rotorua Daily post.</a></p></article>
