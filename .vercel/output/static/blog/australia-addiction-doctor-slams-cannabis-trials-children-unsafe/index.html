        <article><p>An addiction doctor has slammed the rush to legalise medical marijuana for sick children, warning there's no evidence it is safe for young brains.</p><p>&quot;It shouldn't be used at all on children or adolescents,&quot; said Dr Philip Crowley, an addiction medicine specialist at the Royal Adelaide Hospital who will present his views at a medical conference on Friday.</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_3459&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;620&quot;]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1473925273193-2.jpg" alt="Addiction expert Dr Philip Crowley says &#34;we know cannabis is toxic to the developing brain in kids&#34;.

Photo: APnts,&quot; said Dr Philip Crowley, an addiction medicine specialist at the Royal Adelaide Hospital who will present his views at a medical conference on Friday.[/caption]</p><p></p><p>&quot;We now know cannabis is toxic to the developing brain in kids and adolescents. It leads to long-term damage to structures that are vital for memory, learning and thinking.&quot;</p><p>His comments come as states begin opening up medical cannabis to children with severe epilepsy.</p><p>Proponents argue therapeutic compounds from cannabis provide at least some relief for suffering children already with poor development prospects due to illness and for whom other drugs have failed.</p><p>International trials with sick children have focused on the cannabidiol (CBD) component of the plant, rather than tetrahydrocannabinol (THC – which has psycho-active properties), although some involve a combination of both.</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_3460&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;620&quot;]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1473925273193-1.jpg" alt="Medicinal cannabis was recently legalised.

Photo: GWPharma[/caption]</p><p></p><p>Fairfax Media understands the medicinal cannabis Victorians have access to will either be pure CBD or have a very high CBD and low THC content.</p><p>Dr Crowley said researchers have found chronic cannabis use may alter <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055821">brain structure and function in adolescents</a>, and several studies, including as recently as last year, found a link between early use and poor development outcomes.</p><p>&quot;There needs to be a lot more studies done on animals, there needs to be evidence that its not going to cause harm,&quot; he said, adding that he was worried about both CBD and THC products.</p><p>Professor Uri Kramer, a paediatric neurologist who has been running cannabis trials on children in Israel, said the damage the drug could do was &quot;peanuts&quot; compared to the harm caused by severe epilepsy.</p><p>About 80 per cent of the 160 children involved in the Israeli trials are clinically retarded, he said.  &quot;We're not talking about normal children that I'm giving CBD (cannabidiol), we're talking about children with severe disease. If I'm not controlling the seizures they will be more retarded.&quot;</p><p>The recent <a href="http://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(16)00005-4/abstract">findings</a> from the Israeli study, which involves three hospitals, showed nearly 20 per cent of patients experienced a more than 75 per cent reduction in seizures, while 34 per cent reported at least a 50 per cent reduction.</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_3461&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;620&quot;]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1473925273193.jpg" alt="Premier Daniel Andrews inspects a medical cannabis facility.
