        <article><blockquote><p>A woman who made herself cannabis cookies for pain relief has been discharged without a conviction, partly because she needed to travel to care for ill relatives.</p><p>Alexandra Purucker, 60, of Takaka, who was charged with cultivating and possessing cannabis, was discharged without conviction in the Nelson District Court on Tuesday.</p><p>Prosecutor Sergeant Graeme Eden said police went to Purucker's Takaka property on February 6 for an unrelated matter and discovered five plants scattered around her property.</p><p>While police searched inside the property they discovered 71 grams of cannabis in her bedroom.</p><p>Defence counsel Garry Barkle said Purucker suffered from sciatica and made herself cannabis cookies for pain relief purposes.</p><p>If Purucker was convicted, she would not be able to travel to Germany regularly to see her mother and aunt who had dementia-related illnesses, she would not be able to move to Australia and she would never be able to complete the New Zealand citizenship process.</p><p>The offending was on the lower end of the spectrum, he said.</p><p>Judge Peter Butler said he was satisfied that Purucker only grew the plants for her personal use.</p><p>The fact that no irrigation, lighting or special tools were used for growing the plants helped her cause, he said.</p><p>Having no other siblings, having the power of attorney and being the regular caregiver of her aunt and mother in Germany was significant, he said.</p><p>He decided to exercise his discretion to discharge the woman without a conviction to what could otherwise have had very serious consequences.</p><p>He ordered the destruction of the plants.</p></blockquote><p>Article written by Sasha Borissenko for the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/10072257/No-conviction-over-cannabis">Nelson Mail</a> in May 2014</p></article>
