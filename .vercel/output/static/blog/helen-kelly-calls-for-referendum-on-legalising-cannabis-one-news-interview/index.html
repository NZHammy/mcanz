        <article><h4>Terminally ill former Council of Trade Unions president Helen Kelly is calling for a referendum at the next general election on legalising cannabis for both medicinal and recreational use.</h4><p>Ms Kelly, who was diagnosed with lung cancer early last year, says she is using cannabis for pain relief and would like it to be available legally.</p><p>&quot;I think if we can have a referendum on the flag - everyone's, you know, pretty half hearted about that - we can have a referendum at the next election,&quot; she told ONE News.</p><p>&quot;And we can have it on both questions actually. We have have it on medical, and people are interested in the criminalisation issue as well 'cause there are strong arguments,&quot; she said.</p><p>[wpvideo EX8EwObg] &quot;I mean I'm promoting medical use, but if you had both questions people could choose what they want to.&quot; Ms Kelly says New Zealanders are interested in both questions &quot;and I think a referendum at the next election would be a brilliant thing, and create huge interest from people&quot;. Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne has previously said the Government will not be swayed by &quot;emotional nonsense&quot; colouring calls for wider access to medicinal cannabis. He said there had only ever been one application for a dispensation to use cannabis products not registered in New Zealand - for Nelson teenager Alex Renton - which he had approved. Ms Kelly is planning to apply to the Ministry of Health to use a medical cannabis product which she says makes up 30 per cent of the Californian market in medical cannabis.</p><p>&quot;So it's a perfectly legitimate, tested, available product that doctors are prescribing in the states and yet I'm at risk of it not being approved here,&quot; she said. Ms Kelly says she has just had 10 days of radiation on her brain and spine, is on chemotherapy and the cancer has spread throughout her body, but &quot;all things considered I'm alright&quot;.</p><p>Source article  <a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/terminally-ill-helen-kelly-calls-for-referendum-on-legalising-cannabis.html">One News</a></p></article>
