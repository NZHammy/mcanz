Today, Paige has two or three seizures a week.</p><p>&quot;We were at home at the time and saw a news piece about a little girl overseas who used medicinal cannabis and we knew we had to try it for Paige,' Gallien said.</p><p>&quot;At the time, I didn't realise how difficult it would be to secure [Sativex].</p><p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_3388&quot; align=&quot;alignright&quot; width=&quot;620&quot;]<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Paige1.jpg" alt="Sativex has been legal in New Zealand since 2008 but has only partial approval, meaning each application has to be authorised through the Health Minister's office."/> Sativex has been legal in New Zealand since 2008 but has only partial approval, meaning each application has to be authorised through the Health Minister's office.[/caption]</p><p>&quot;It was such a taboo word, the 'c' word.&quot;</p><p>But a survey by the NZ Drug Foundation shows 64 per cent of respondents think personal use of small amounts of cannabis should be allowed.</p><p>The foundation's director Ross Bell said the results show voters are ready for a change.</p><p>&quot;This poll shows that it doesn't matter what party people back, there is consistent support to move away from the criminal justice approach to drugs,&quot; said Bell.</p><p>&quot;The results confirm our sense of a shift in public mood.</p><p>This poll is important because it shows people understand drug law changes aren't just a choice of either sticking with the black market status quo or lurching to sales from the corner dairy, Bell said.</p><p>&quot;It was an old political truth that any changes to drug law was a poisoned chalice, but this poll well and truly busts that myth. There's a message here for politicians: they no longer need to fear talking about drug law reform.&quot;</p><p>The foundation's director Ross Bell said the results show voters are ready for a change.</p><p>&quot;This poll shows that it doesn't matter what party people back, there is consistent support to move away from the criminal justice approach to drugs,&quot; said Bell.</p><p>&quot;The results confirm our sense of a shift in public mood.</p><p>This poll is important because it shows people understand drug law changes aren't just a choice of either sticking with the black market status quo or lurching to sales from the corner dairy, Bell said.</p><p>&quot;It was an old political truth that any changes to drug law was a poisoned chalice, but this poll well and truly busts that myth.

Days after her first dose, two years ago, she drew a picture of a smiley face, which was a massive achievement.</p><p>The teen now enjoys the playground and watching musical group High-5. She weighs less than 30 kg but &quot;is as healthy as can be&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Paige has trouble with walking, verbal.. just your general everyday stuff,&quot; Gallien said.</p><p>&quot;We're lucky she's still here basically.&quot;</p><p>The spray contains half the level of THC - the compound that gives the psychoactive &quot;high&quot; - usually found in cannabis.</p><p>The family does not receive a subsidy for the drug, which costs about $1000 a month for three bottles.</p><p>&quot;We have been doing some <a href="https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/legalmcfor10">fundraising</a> and once that goes I don't know how we're going to survive on doing it,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Funding needs to happen, we just can't live without the medicinal use of it anymore.</p><p>&quot;The politicians they have no idea what we go through day-to-day and the life we've got now with our little ones. If they could see the difference it makes to [a patient's] quality of life, they might see that it's all worth it.&quot;</p><p></p><p>Article written by Donna Lee Biddle for the Waikato Times, original article can be found here on stuff.</p><p></p><p>Please consider donating to our fundraiser for Kelly's daughter Paige and others like her.</p><p>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://widget.givealittle.co.nz/cause/legalmcfor10/light-starbuck&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; seamless=&quot;seamless&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p></article>
