Helen Kelly, has been knocked back by a Parliamentary committee.</p><p>Over 4000 people signed an online petition calling for Ms Kelly to be allowed to use cannabis oil to help control the pain and nausea her disease is causing her.</p><p>However Parliament's Health Select Committee said the Government doesn't support the use of unprocessed cannabis for medicinal purposes because the dose and potency can't be controlled, and also because of the risk of contaminants.</p><p>The Committee said there's no Government opposition to the use of cannabis-based medicines - but Sativex is the only product approved for use here.</p></article>
