        <article><p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/logo-who-300x120.jpg" alt=""/></p><p>Late last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) held the 41st meeting of the Expert Committee of Drug Dependence (ECDD). This was a historic meeting as it was the first review of Cannabis scheduling in international treaties since before the existence of the UN or WHO.</p><p>After a delay in reporting the results due to suspected political pressure, an internal letter to the UN Secretary-General containing a raft of recommendations regarding Cannabis and its extracts <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/read-the-world-health-organizations-marijuana-rescheduling-recommendations/">has been leaked.</a></p><p>A key recommendation was to remove raw Cannabis and its resins from Schedule IV which is the &quot;prohibition&quot; scheduling, where it was placed next to Heroin and various Fentanyl derivatives, essentially a list of the most dangerous drugs known to man.</p><p>Another recommendation was for Cannabis medicines that cannot easily be refined to extract THC, be put in schedule III, next to low-risk preparations such as Paracetamol/Codeine combination drugs, which are available on consultation with a pharmacist.  Coincidentally, this reaffirms the position of Medical Cannabis in Dr. Shane Reti's Medical Cannabis Bill, where Cannabis medicines would no longer be Prescription medicines, but Pharmacist only medicines.</p><p>&quot;I hope that our Regulatory team writing up the Medical Scheme pay close attention to how this unfolds at the international level, as it sends a strong signal on our scheduling of such substances.&quot; &quot;I suspect once these schedulings are entrenched our Government will have to review the schedulings of Cannabis with regards to the Misuse of Drugs Act&quot; adding further pressure to conduct a review of this antiquated piece of legislation,&quot; Says MCANZ Coordinator Shane Le Brun.</p></article>
