        <article><p>A woman who may have otherwise died from her regular severe seizures has been granted approval for medical marijuana funding.</p><p>Alisha Butt, 20, has the mentality of a toddler and is unable to speak.</p><p>Her seizures had presented a huge problem for specialists who were unable to adequately treat her, leading to the possibility she could end up in a coma from one and die.</p><p>But thanks to medicinal marijuana extract Sativex, Alisha is able to live a more comfortable life.</p><p>“Since being on Sativex for over 4 months, she has shown a great improvement,” mum Sushila Butt said.</p><p>“Her seizures have decreased immensely and now, after long last, Alisha has been able to enjoy a better quality of life without the disturbance of erratic and continuous prolonged seizures.”</p><p>Alisha, who has been admitted to hospital numerous times from her uncontrolled seizures, had previously suffered side effects from other drugs trialled on her.</p><p>Her father Boyd Butt said the new treatment cover was a relief – although it hadn’t been easy getting funding from the Government pharmaceuticals agency Pharmac.</p><p>“The thing is, we got the message from the specialist that she could go into a coma and die because it had gotten that bad,” he said.</p><p>Then, in September, Alisha was approved by the minister of Health to receive Sativex – which contains Cannabidiol with Tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis – but the family had to fund the $1000-a-month treatment themselves.</p><p>It wasn’t until January 22 that the Government agreed to fund the medicinal marijuana as a prescription.</p><p>“It’s completely covered now,” Sushila said. “It will be fully funded for my daughter.</p><p>Sativex can be prescribed in New Zealand, subject to approval by the Minister of Health. Ministerial approval for pharmaceutical grade cannabis products such as Sativex is delegated to Ministry officials.</p><p>The family’s doctor had made an application to Pharmac to fund the drug for Alisha under exceptional circumstances.</p><p>It was Alisha’s parents who campaigned to have the funding approved, though.</p><p>“I have been writing to the District Health Board and Pharmac nearly every day,” Sushila said.</p><p>The drug should be readily available to New Zealanders who needed it, Boyd said, rather than taking months of pleading for a special dispensation.</p><p>“It basically saved our child’s life and helped her a great deal,” he said.</p><p>“If anyone else is in the same situation they should have the opportunity to have it as well, if they want it.”</p><p></p><p>Originally posted on <em><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/76355498/medical-marijuana-funding-approved-for-northland-woman">stuff.co.nz</a></em></p></article>
