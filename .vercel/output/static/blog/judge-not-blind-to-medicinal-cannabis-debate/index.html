        <article><blockquote><p>A judge has said he's &quot;not blind to the debate&quot; around medicinal cannabis in New Zealand during the sentencing of a man who used the drug to help him cope with Crohn's disease.</p><p>Peter John Crimp, 40, appeared in the Nelson District Court on Monday charged with possession of cannabis and a cannabis pipe.</p><p>The court heard that Crimp was driving on the Moutere Highway in the Redwood Valley about 7:50pm on September 19 when he was stopped by police.</p><p>While speaking to police, the officer noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the vehicle.</p><p>Police searched Crimp and his vehicle and found a small tin containing two grams of cannabis in his pocket and a small pipe.</p><p>Crimp admitted the pipe was used for smoking cannabis and told police he used it to self-medicate.</p><p>Defence lawyer Rob Ord said Crimp has Crohn's disease and used cannabis for pain relief.</p><p>&quot;This man's lost most of his intestines,&quot; he said.</p><p>Ord said Crimp had access to morphine legally.</p><p>&quot;The problem is he actually prefers the cannabis. He says it works for him.&quot;</p><p>Crimp believed cannabis use had prolonged his life by 10 years, Ord said.</p><p>Judge Richard Russell said it was &quot;not appropriate&quot; to sentence Crimp to community work and decided not to impose a fine.</p><p>&quot;I'm not blind to the debate that's going on around the wider medicinal use of cannabis,&quot; he said.</p><p>Crimp was convicted and sentenced to six months' supervision with the condition that he completes any recommended drug counselling and treatment.</p><p>There was also an order for the destruction of the cannabis and pipe.</p><p>The family of Nelson teenager Alex Renton sparked a national debate around the use of medicinal cannabis when they campaigned on his behalf to treat his unexplained seizures with a cannabinoid oil.</p><p>Renton died on July 1 after being in an induced coma for three months. He was the first person to receive a cannabidiol product that was signed-off by a Government minister.</p></blockquote><p>Originally sourced from <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/73166735/Judge-not-blind-to-medicinal-cannabis-debate">stuff.co.nz</a></p><p>For examples of the benefits of Cannabinoid based medicines for Chron's disease <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-marijuana-achieves-complete-remission-crohns-disease-drug-improves-appetite-and-sleep-247783">read here</a>Â or for a more technical explanation, <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/356512">here.</a></p></article>
