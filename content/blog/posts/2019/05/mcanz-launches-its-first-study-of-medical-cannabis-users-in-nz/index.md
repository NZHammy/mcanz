An unprecedented research project to discover how and why New Zealanders are using cannabis medicinally has been launched today by Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand.

The study, _New Zealand Medicinal Cannabis Use Research Survey 2019_, is an online survey of patients using cannabis for medical reasons based on Australia's [_Cannabis As Medicine Survey_](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2018/209/5/medicinal-cannabis-australia-2016-cannabis-medicine-survey-cams-16) and has been designed in conjunction with University of Otago researcher [Dr Geoff Noller](https://www.otago.ac.nz/dsm/people/expertise/profile/index.html?id=3030). It has been granted ethics approval and is MCANZ's first research project.

"During the Select Committee process last year, it became apparent that no one had any data on the trends in illicit medical use, such as the rate of criminalization or even a decent snapshot of what conditions were most common for illicit medical use," says MCANZ Coordinator Shane Le Brun.

"The only research relevant was a Ministry of Health study on cannabis use dating from 2012-2013, and frankly, medical use was only an afterthought in that research," says MCANZ Le Brun.

"This research is a first for MCANZ and we're delighted to be working with  Dr Noller. This first survey will give us a snapshot of current medical use in New Zealand and establish trends and areas that will need focus in the setting up of New Zealand's new medicinal cannabis regime," says Le Brun

"The intent is for this study to be conducted every 2 years, so the first study will serve as a baseline for the future, particularly to measure the impact of the Medical Cannabis Scheme," says Lead investigator  Dr. Geoff Noller.

"The study covers topics ranging from perceived medical efficacy, knowledge of harm reduction such as vaping, and the impact of criminality on medical use," says Noller.
