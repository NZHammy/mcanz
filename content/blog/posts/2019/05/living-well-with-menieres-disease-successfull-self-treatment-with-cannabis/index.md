\[caption id="attachment\_7354" align="alignright" width="341"\]![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/205022.jpg) Meniere's disease has an unknown cause but results in fluid build-up within the ear that damages structures, resulting in deafness, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting and vertigo.\-mood getting dark\[/caption\]

\- numbness increasing behind my ear

 

\-tinnitus intensifying -brain fog clouding in -sense of smell strengthening -dizziness nauseating -temperature rising -balance shifting -sweating profusely -surroundings moving **\*Meniere's attack imminent\*** Round and round and round goes the world you find a spot to focus on so it's not so massive Grab a door, fall to the floor or if your lucky grab hold off a toilet Round and round and round So Hot violent convulsions vomit that seems to come from your toes Drenched in sweat Now your bowel lets go So untidy - No time to care On and On and On No Strength -No energy -No self-worth spinning slows shaking starts crawl to a safe place When and where will the next attack be ANYTIME ANYWHERE MENIERES DOESNT CARE Menieres was ruling my life and stealing my purpose The doctors are great but there is no cure so all they have is maybes Maybe this might work Betahistine, Valium, Ativan, Meclizine, Zofran, Sumatriptan gentamicin injections in your ear, grommets, cochlear implants, \* side effects side effects side effects\*

 

My energy, my fitness, and my mental stability were at an all-time low and I was about to give up on my dreams Till the day I accidentally had a couple of bites of a cannabis cake, for me\*IT CHANGED EVERYTHING\* I discovered

- My Brain fog lifted
- My Nausea dissipated
- My balanced regained
- My tinnitus decreased

**NO MORE ATTACKS**

My main side effect was that I couldn't stop smiling

After trial and error, I now make a capsule filled with coconut oil infused with cannabis leaf two capsules every eight hours and I am now 8 months attack free I now live with Meniere's and it no longer rules me cannabis has given me my self-worth back and helps me deal with all the symptoms of my disease BRING ON MEDICAL CANNABIS we need more understanding of this amazing plant and its healing properties I know it's illegal and I know its not good to self medicate but when something works so well those risks I'm willing to take The dose I take is very low and I take as little as possible. I recommend if anyone thinks to try, start with the common recommendation of start low and go slow....  too much is not good and you could be surprised how little is needed!
