## Q1. Who are you, where are you based and what do you do?

My name is Mark Dye, and I am the CEO of Auckland based NUBU Pharmaceuticals.

## Q2. Will you offer compassionate discounts, (community service card holders, pensioners etc)?

I am unable to answer this question as suppliers of unapproved medicines are unable to communicate in a manner that Medsafe would consider advertising. Sorry.

## Q3. Do you have plans for trials regarding chronic pain?

We are working with a number of international companies who are completing trials on various conditions in a number of regions, but at this point in time we aren’t looking to complete a chronic pain trial locally.

## Q4. What certification programs, i.e. organic and others, are you or the industry planning to belong to?

Most cannabis that is grown qualifies as organic whether it is certified or not. Our goal however is to source only certified organic cannabis.

## Q5. How do you manage your pest/weed regime?

NUBU isn’t going to grow cannabis. We are a distribution/innovation company. Our focus is the distribution of product from international partners into New Zealand, and the export of premium ‘value add’ cannabis based products (with a hint of New Zealand), to the rest of the world.

## Q6. Will you your plants see the light of the sun, and will they be grown in soil? vs indoor & hydroponic growing

We will source cannabis cultivated both indoor and outdoor – what we get from where will very much depend on the finished product we are creating, standards and consumer preference/expectation for that particular product.

## Q7. Are you planning on including animals who would benefit from CBD for various ailments eg. epilepsy?

It is something we have been investigating, but our priority is the human population currently.

## Q8. Are you focusing on any particular terpenes?

We are looking at a wide range of terpene and cannabinoid profiles.

## Q9. Do you have plans for phase 2 trials, if so, for what conditions?

See response to Q3

## Q10. CO2 or Ethanol extraction?

Co2

## Q11. Will you have a recommended retail price so that customers can have price certainty and consistency as well as setting a reasonable price?

I am unable to answer this question as suppliers of unapproved medicines are unable to communicate in a manner that Medsafe would consider advertising. Sorry.

## Q12. What is your best yielding variety so far?

See response to Q6

## Q13. What strains will be available now and in the future?

I am unable to answer this question as suppliers of unapproved medicines are unable to communicate in a manner that Medsafe would consider advertising. Sorry.

## Q14. How is GMP tested?

I am unable to answer this question as suppliers of unapproved medicines are unable to communicate in a manner that Medsafe would consider advertising. Sorry.

## Q15. What does a typical day in the office look like at the moment?

Due to the nature of NUBU’s business, I work across multiple time zones – North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. So my day generally starts in bed dealing with WhatsApp messages from international partners. By 9am I have generally had a couple of calls with either North America or Europe, and then start on my New Zealand based work. By the time I have a hold of what is happening in New Zealand it is generally time for Europe to wake up again, and the process repeats.

## Q16. What prompted you to get involved in the MC industry?

I used to work on talkback radio, and after speaking about medicinal cannabis on the radio one day and realising the wide range of need for the product, my friend and now business partner, Will Douglas, and I decided we should look to start a cannabis company. It doesn’t sound that out of place now, but this was back in 2016, well before cannabis was being talked about like it is now.

## Q17. Do you intend to conduct trials for conditions where there is already evidence of efficacy?

I am unable to answer this question as suppliers of unapproved medicines are unable to communicate in a manner that Medsafe would consider advertising. Sorry.

## Q18. When do you plan to have product ready for market?

I am unable to answer this question as suppliers of unapproved medicines are unable to communicate in a manner that Medsafe would consider advertising. Sorry.
