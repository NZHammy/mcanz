> A judge has said he's "not blind to the debate" around medicinal cannabis in New Zealand during the sentencing of a man who used the drug to help him cope with Crohn's disease.
> 
> Peter John Crimp, 40, appeared in the Nelson District Court on Monday charged with possession of cannabis and a cannabis pipe.
> 
> The court heard that Crimp was driving on the Moutere Highway in the Redwood Valley about 7:50pm on September 19 when he was stopped by police.
> 
> While speaking to police, the officer noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the vehicle.
> 
> Police searched Crimp and his vehicle and found a small tin containing two grams of cannabis in his pocket and a small pipe.
> 
> Crimp admitted the pipe was used for smoking cannabis and told police he used it to self-medicate.
> 
> Defence lawyer Rob Ord said Crimp has Crohn's disease and used cannabis for pain relief.
> 
> "This man's lost most of his intestines," he said.
> 
> Ord said Crimp had access to morphine legally.
> 
> "The problem is he actually prefers the cannabis. He says it works for him."
> 
> Crimp believed cannabis use had prolonged his life by 10 years, Ord said.
> 
> Judge Richard Russell said it was "not appropriate" to sentence Crimp to community work and decided not to impose a fine.
> 
> "I'm not blind to the debate that's going on around the wider medicinal use of cannabis," he said.
> 
> Crimp was convicted and sentenced to six months' supervision with the condition that he completes any recommended drug counselling and treatment.
> 
> There was also an order for the destruction of the cannabis and pipe.
> 
> The family of Nelson teenager Alex Renton sparked a national debate around the use of medicinal cannabis when they campaigned on his behalf to treat his unexplained seizures with a cannabinoid oil.
> 
> Renton died on July 1 after being in an induced coma for three months. He was the first person to receive a cannabidiol product that was signed-off by a Government minister.
