> Children's Commissioner Dr Russell Wills says New Zealand should be trialling medicinal cannabis for children.
> 
> His comments come as an eleven-year-old girl becomes the first New Zealand child to be prescribed medicinal cannabis extract, called Sativex.
> 
> The girl, Paige, has Dravet Syndrome, a rare but lethal form of epilepsy.
> 
> Parents Brent and Kelly say their daughter suffered up to fifteen seizures a night. She suffered brain damage and had the mental age of a three year-old.
> 
> "The information the doctor gave at the time was that she probably wouldn't live past nine or ten,"says father Brent.
> 
> Sativex has been approved for Multiple Sclerosis and chronic pain sufferers.
> 
> But its use - untested for a child - has Dr Wills worried. He says Sativex may have side effects for children including sedation and hallucinations.
> 
> "We know those side effects can be pretty substantial," he says.
> 
> Because of those fears, he says some parents are breaking the law to make another form of cannabis oil they believe is far safer.
