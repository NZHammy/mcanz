[Seven sharp](http://tvnz.co.nz/seven-sharp/teen-in-coma-57-days-needs-legal-access-cannabis-oil-video-6332506) have done an interview with the family of the young man with suspected Encephalitis who has been in a coma for 57 days and counting.

> Mike Hosking: On a day where we found out that the courts weren’t in a position to help Lecretia Seales, what did the judge say, it’s really only Parliament’s job who can do that, we want to introduce you to a young man who has a similar vexed battle on his hands.
> 
> Nineteen year old Alex Renton, he’s been in a coma for fifty seven days with a mystery illness.
> 
> Nadine: The drugs haven’t fixed him but his family is holding out hope, because they believe Alex’s saviour could be cannabis oil. Problem is it’s illegal. So could a law change in this case save a life?
