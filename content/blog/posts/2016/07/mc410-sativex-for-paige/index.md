Paige was the first child in New Zealand to legally access a Cannabis Based product, in this case Sativex.  There was much media coverage at the time with the family featuring on Sunday, Newspapers etc.  She was only 11 years old when she started on Sativex, and she has been on it ever since.

Paige is now 13 years old,  her initial diagnosis with Dravets syndrome was when she was just two years old. She has developmental delays, especially cognitive difficulties, she's now at a mental age of about 5 years of age. Paige suffers from every seizure type there is, she was having up to 20 or more seizures a night at her worst, but after starting sativex two years ago she is down to having one to three seizures a week.  However lately Paige has been going through a rough patch of heightened seizure activity.

Sativex has cost the family well over $10,000 dollars so far, which her mother Kelly has had to fund herself from doing fundraisers, and she would also like to one day apply under the MOH Guidelines for a product that is both cheaper, and designed for Paediatric Epilepsy.

Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand (MCANZ) is pleased to announce Paige as the 5th Patient in our #MC410 fundraising campaign, aiming to ease the financial burden on families struggling with severe medical conditions.
