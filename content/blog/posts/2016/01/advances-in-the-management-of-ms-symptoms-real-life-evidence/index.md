### Abstract

Once the efficacy and tolerability of a new intervention have been demonstrated in clinical trials under ideal experimental conditions, observational studies within approved label conditions are performed to determine its effectiveness in real-world use and expand the safety/tolerability data. Several large observational studies have been conducted of Sativex(®) (THC:CBD) oromucosal spray as add-on therapy for moderate-to-severe treatment-resistant multiple sclerosis (MS) spasticity. Studies performed to date with a focus on tolerability have confirmed the absence of abuse, misuse, addiction and lack of impairment of cognition or driving ability. Open-label studies performed to date with a focus on effectiveness have indicated that about one-half to two-thirds of patients initiated on THC:CBD oromucosal spray continue to derive benefit after 3 months' treatment at a mean dosage of 5-7 sprays/day.
