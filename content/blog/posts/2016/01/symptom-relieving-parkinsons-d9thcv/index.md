**BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE** Previous findings have indicated that a cannabinoid, such as Δ9\-THCV, which has antioxidant properties and the ability to activate CB2 receptors but to block CB1, might be a promising therapy for alleviating symptoms and delaying neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD).

**EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH** The ability of Δ9\-THCV to reduce motor inhibition and provide neuroprotection was investigated in rats lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine and in mice lesioned with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

**KEY RESULTS** Acute administration of Δ9\-THCV attenuated the motor inhibition caused by 6-hydroxydopamine, presumably through changes in glutamatergic transmission. Moreover, chronic administration of Δ9\-THCV attenuated the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase–positive neurones caused by 6-hydroxydopamine in the substantia nigra, through an effect related to its antioxidant properties (it was reproduced by cannabidiol -enriched botanical extract). In addition, CB2 receptor–deficient mice responded to 6-hydroxydopamine in a similar manner to wild-type animals, and CB2 receptors were poorly up-regulated in the rat substantia nigra in response to 6-hydroxydopamine. By contrast, the substantia nigra of mice that had been injected with LPS exhibited a greater up-regulation of CB2 receptors. In these animals, Δ9\-THCV also caused preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase–positive neurones. This effect probably involved CB2 receptors as it was also elicited by the selective CB2 receptor agonist, HU-308, and CB2 receptor–deficient mice were more vulnerable to LPS lesions.

**CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS** Given its antioxidant properties and its ability to activate CB2 but to block CB1 receptors, Δ9\-THCV has a promising pharmacological profile for delaying disease progression in PD and also for ameliorating parkinsonian symptoms.
