Film director Duncan Jones has revealed his support for medical marijuana after revealing his beloved wife Rodene has found 'a world of relief' through the drug as she battles breast cancer.

Duncan, 41, the son of David Bowie, told how his 33-year-old wife has been using marijuana - which is legal in their home state of California - to ease her pain as she undergoes gruelling chemotherapy treatment.

And the award-winning director of hit movies Moon and Source Code, tweeted his appreciation for 'one of the unique aspects of living in California', adding: 'It's been both wonderful & at times hilarious to see Rodene finding a world of relief from cancer through these drugs..

Brave: Duncan Jones and his wife Rodene Ronquillo shaved their heads in preparation for her chemotherapy treatment

The couple, who live in Los Angeles, wed in secret after Rodene, a talented photographer, was diagnosed with cancer on November 7.

Rodene has revealed that she still has six rounds of chemotherapy left, followed by a mastectomy and radiation.

And Duncan, who shaved his head in support of his wife, added: 'Those who have an issue with marijuana for medicinal use, all I can say is you have no idea what a boon it is for cancer pain management.

'She does not smoke. The pharmacies here in CA have a variety of ways to partake. Ro prefers tinctures and... chocolates!

Duncan and Rodene became engaged last summer, but were prompted to marry following Rodene's diagnosis.

They then made the brave decision to make Rodene's diagnosis public and have now raised more than $6000 for [The Breast Cancer Research Foundation](http://www.fundraiseforbcrf.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=1021963&supid=374586538) \- with a target of $11,612.
