MCANZ is grateful for the public endorsement from Helen Kelly, who is the only notable public figure tackling this issue from a genuine personal need. We hope in future that other public figures and Charities will join us in publicly taking a positive stance on this issue, as charities representing MS, Cancer etc have been largely silent, to the detriment of the patient groups they purport to represent.

“Its Prime goal is to make sure that families that have got legal access to Medicinal Cannabis are able to afford to fund it.” Says Helen Kelly

“We need a proper medical cannabis law in New Zealand to make this accessible, to have it funded but in the meantime there are families with desperate people missing out on what has been a fantastic drug for me, the best drug available, for pain relief, for Nausea, for the Stimulation of my appetite..” Says Helen Kelly

“I have got cancer everywhere, and it has enable me to have a full night’s sleep, to be comfortable, to be pain free” Says Helen Kelly

“It’s important to realize that not everyone is in a position to flout the law as Helen does, some, like a patient we are fundraising for are in care facilities, while others, with severe disabilities relating to Multiple Sclerosis, are in no position to get stuck into the gardening as it were.” Says Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand Coordinator Shane Le Brun

“We have 1 legal option Pharmaceutical grade option, which while not suitable for everyone, and almost unobtainable, it is proving possible to access for those with the most extreme need” says Shane Le Brun

“We are fundraising for 10 of these patients with extreme need from up and down the country under our #MC410 campaign, in these cases the Medical Profession and the Ministry are not a barrier to access, only the cost” says Shane Le Brun

“We hope with the support of New Zealanders we can continue to support these 10 needy patients receive a potentially life changing treatment, as already one of our patients has had improvements in Seizure activity, reduction in pain relief and dramatic improvements in sleeping patterns, additionally giving the family caring for him an improvement in their lives, easing the burden of several people,” says Shane Le Brun
