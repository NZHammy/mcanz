![Spark Foundation payroll giving](http://mcawarenessnz.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SPA1267-Spark-Foundation-Graphic-v2-2.jpg)We are pleased to say that Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand is now set up for Payroll Giving.

 

The Spark Foundation launched in July 2011 and one of their principles is to encourage generosity through theur Payroll Giving program. This program enables Spark employees to nominate an amount to be deducted from their salary as a one-off or an on-going donation to a registered charity or school of their choice. To date, Spark people, Spark and the Spark Foundation have donated over $4 million of payroll giving and matched donations to registered charities and schools.

The Spark Foundation is delighted to support the organisations that are important to their employees by matching donations made through Payroll Giving up to $500 per employee, per year,  effectively doubling the difference that Spark Employees can make to charities such as Medical Cannabis Awareness New Zealand.

If you know a Spark Employee,  let them know about us, and the difference they can make.
