While I began my journey middle of 2016 to switch from Sativex to Tilray, it was not until February 2017 I was able to begin using it. Initially, I couldn’t see how three mls of the Tilray oil daily was going to help. I wondered if the switch would be any use and I was nervous about the pain returning.  Fortunately It worked almost immediately, and yet it was subtle. I just suddenly noticed my pain had reduced, although I didn’t wait for the pain to stop, it just seemed to reduce and that was it. Overtime, I have lost 21 kilos as I am no longer craving the sugar I craved when on opiates. I have felt as though my insides are healing, I am not having the pain and spasms I use to have. It is now relatively minor. I still have my osteo pain and I still need help to sleep at night but my life has improved immensely on Tilray.

Tilray itself is simply grapeseed oil and cannabis oil, it is tasteless. In contrast, Sativex left me smelling as though I had been consuming alcohol and cannabis all day. It also didn’t reduce my spasms and it worked but not in the same way Tilray is working. I do not know why, but the Tilray is definitely better. Since using Tilray, and aware the cost is out of the league for most people, including myself, I would highly recommend we have the legal options to be able to make or buy our own NZ made oil because Tilray is very good, however, most wont know as it’s still too expensive.

Considering all the results I have experienced

, and knowing I cannot keep paying for the high costs of medicinal cannabis that’s available legally, I now have to make the difficult decision of whether I can continue down the legal road or look for illegal alternatives. It is a difficult decision as it will compromise my ability to stay in my job. However, one thing I do know, is **I wont be returning to opiates anytime soon.**
