# Press Release:   International Changes for Cannabis loom as the DEA Reschedules CBD

 

Today the US Drug enforcement agency (DEA) has made a historic announcement, announcing that Cannabidiol (CBD) is to be moved from the Schedule 1 to schedule 5.  This means it transitions from a drug rated worse the methamphetamine, to one at the safer end of prescription drugs.

“This is the first time that the agency has been forced to go on the record and admit that cannabis has therapeutic value”

“There is still some way to go, as the definition of CBD is even more stringent than NZ’s 98% pure definition, but it ties into what the WHO have concluded,” Says MCANZ Coordinator Shane Le Brun

Earlier this year a review of CBD was done by the World Health organizations expert committee on drug dependence which came to the conclusion that CBD [does not belong in the controlled substances list](http://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/UNSG_SignedDGletter.pdf?ua=1).  Additionally, there was enough evidence to go ahead with a review for cannabis generally, which will take place next year.

“The DEA Decision follows FDA approval for Epidiolex, and an admission by the World Health Organization that CBD is vastly different from typical Cannabis and doesn’t belong in international treaties” “CBD offers so much promise, even as a mere wellness product, that large companies like coca cola are reviewing their options in this space” “Unfortunately in this space it appears that NZ is falling further behind, as our 100 day promise from Labour could potentially turn into a 1000 day promise once the regulations are sorted,” Says MCANZ Coordinator Shane Le Brun.
