# The process

Generally GPs in NZ aren't all yet equipped with the knowledge or time to prescribe Medical Cannabis, its usually a suggestion directly from GPs to see a specialist clinic.

Specialist clinics have been the easiest for most to work with, however some still have good luck with their GP, so if you're in for an appointment, do ask and see if they are able to help.

Specialist clinics have a huge amount of previously built up knowledge which will help them work with your specifics.

Cannabis is prescribed for a range of conditions, you most likely qualify, and if you're reading this, well, there you go.

We have all been on a journey towards this point, we all have some kind of history that lead us to questioning if cannabis can help. Be honest with your doctors, if you're a current cannabis consumer, explain how it helps you now, if you're looking into cannabis for the first time, explain how you believe it's going to improve your life.

The first step is booking your appointment, the doctors and nurses all have a wealth of information ready to share with you. If you have questions come to mind leading up to your appointment, be sure to write them down and ask it!

Doctors can either approve you for medical cannabis, and write you a script, or they might not. This will be completely up to their discretion.

If you have been approved, if you're with a specialist clinic they may offer to provide you the products directly, or you will be able to get your prescription sent to an ordinary pharmacy. If you're working with your GP, they will be able to send your script to their normal pharmacy, or, mention one of the pharmacies listed below all who have a long history of working with medical cannabis patients.

Pharmacies mostly offer either a pickup, or courier service.

Finally remember: It is easier than you think... and this is a constantly changing landscape.
